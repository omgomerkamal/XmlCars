This repository contains:

a) Xml files
b) xml schema 
c) xml dtd files
d) and Java source code a


Running an Xml file:
you can run an xsl file, which is a special kind of xml with xslt code, but also pure text just as other source code. The interpreter on which the xslt script runs is your browser.
So you need two files:

a. An xml file containing the data and the information which script to use (name it "test.xml"):

b. An xsl file containing the script (name it "test.xsl"):


If your OS doesn't know which program to use on opening the xml file, tell him it's the browser. And yes, you only need any editor like notepad and any browser like firefox or ie. Using one which knows xml is more convinient, but notepad and ie are already a complete development environment - standanlone, without needing any java, so I don't know why you mention it.
